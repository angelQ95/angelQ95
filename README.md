### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer at ISCAS, I am engaged in web full stack development.

In addition to developing code, I like to read books, especially paper books. I am happy to make plans for anything, and I have a strong desire to manage time nodes.

Check out my portfolio here or shoot me an email to angelq1995@163.com if you want to chat!
