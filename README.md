### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer at ISCAS, I am engaged in web full stack development.

In addition to developing code, I like to read books, especially paper books. I am happy to make plans for anything, and I have a strong desire to manage time nodes.

Check out my portfolio here or shoot me an email to angelq1995@163.com if you want to chat!

我是一名来自ISCAS的软件开发工程师，从事web全栈开发工作。

除了开发代吗，我喜欢阅读，尤其是纸质书。我乐于对任何事情做出计划安排，并且对于时间节点有强烈的管理欲望。

欢迎查看我的项目作品，或者你想和我沟通的话，请发送邮件到angelq1995@163.com。
