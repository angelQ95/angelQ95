### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer at ISCAS, I am engaged in web full stack development.

When I'm not debugging mysterious code I didn't write, I'm generally learning something new, especially paper books. I am happy to make plans for anything, and I have a strong desire to manage time nodes.

Check out my portfolio here or shoot me an email to angelq1995@163.com if you want to chat
